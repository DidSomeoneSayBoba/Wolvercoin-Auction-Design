Allow auction for nfts/other items, WVC tokens through ETH(or USD?) for WVC and WVC tokens for nfts and other items


UI:

Buying side:
List each item being sold, ordered by different categories, default by most popular auction for a certain token (ETH or WVC)

List 15~ items per page

Each item has current price(flashes between USD, WVC, ETH), a bid time left, and bid count - with an image of the item being sold (support jpg, gif, png file types)

On clicking an item, a square window pops up for bidding
	-enter amount (in some token or WVC, depending on the item - Wolvercoin can be bid on by ETH or some other token like maybe USD as well through PayPal?) 
	-shows bid history (time, price)
	-shows item description(limit 200 words)
	

Auction system:
	-extend auction time by 10 seconds when a bid is placed within 10 seconds of bid end
	-limit 10 extensions

Selling side:
List each item you've put on auction, current bid price(if not sold), final bid price(if sold)

Clicking on each shows similar ui to selling side (square with description)

Users can list items by putting in a minimum price, bid time, image, description as well as minimum increment amount for bidding

Users can view history of bids, sales, transfers, and in what currency it was done in

Users must show proof of item ownership in order to place a proper item listing

Since our incentive for purchasing WVC with real money is parental units being parental units, what if we uh...... Made their starting prices random between a certain range specified by a survey of the people who own WVC who own HW student IDs (make thingy that scans HW student ID display or something lol)
